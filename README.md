### College Management Platform

### Disclaimer
This project is a work in progress and by No means complete yet.  

### History 
I started this project with the goal of creating a free open source tool for colleges and schools to use to help manage applicant and student data.  This is also a learning project for me, since I come from a Node, Java, and Go background. This is my disclaimer: I am not an advanced Python Flask developer so I am using this project to help me sharpen my Python skills.   

#### Credits: 
This project was inspired by a tutorial project created by Miguel Grinberg. Miguel is a extremely talented Python developer and an excellent teacher.  I remember how highly revered Miguel was when I worked at Rackspace. I was only there for a 6 month tenure working on the Global Enterprise architecture team. While I was there I had the priviledge of working with some of the most talented Python developers in the world.
